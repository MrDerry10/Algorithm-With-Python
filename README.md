### Algorithm for file updates in Python

## Project description

- Within my organization, access to restricted content is managed through an allow list of IP addresses. The file `"allow_list.txt"` contains these authorized IP addresses. Additionally, there's a separate removal list, which identifies IP addresses that should be revoked access. I've devised an algorithm to automate the updating of the `"allow_list.txt"` file, removing these unauthorized IP addresses from accessing the content.

## Open the file that contains the allow list 

```python
# Assign `import_file` to the name of the file
import_file = "allow_list.txt"

```

- i then used the `with` statement to open up the file

  ```python
  # Build `with` statement to read in the initial contents of the file
  with open(import_file, "r") as file:

  ```

In my algorithm, I use the with statement and .open() function in read mode to access the allow list file and retrieve IP addresses. The with keyword ensures the file is automatically closed after use. The code snippet with open(import_file, "r") as file: specifies the file to be read and assigns it to the variable file for use within the with block.

## read the file contents
-to read the file ocntents of a file i used the `.read()` method to convert it into the string.

```pthyon
with open(import_file, "r") as
file:

# use `.read()` to read the imported file and store it in a variable named `ip_addresses`

  ip_addresses = file.read()

```

- Using the with open("allow_list.txt", "r") as file: statement, I read the file’s contents into a string with file.read(), storing it in the ip_addresses variable. This allows me to organize and extract data from the file in my Python program.

## convert the string into a list 

```python
# Use `.split()` to convert `ip_addresses` from a string to a list

ip_addresses = ip_addresses.split()

```

## iterate through the remove list 

- Central to my algorithm's functionality is the iteration through the IP addresses listed in the `remove_list.` To achieve this, I integrated a `for` loop:

```python
# Build iterative statement
# Name loop variable `element`
# Loop through `ip_addresses`
for element in ip_addresses:

```

- In Python, a `for` loop iterates over a sequence, executing code for each element. The loop starts with the `for` keyword, followed by a loop variable (e.g., element) and the in keyword. This iterates through `ip_addresses`, assigning each value to element.

## remove IP addresses that are on the remove list 

-To fulfill the requirements of my algorithm, it's necessary to eliminate any IP address from the `allow_list` `(ip_addresses)` that also appears in the `remove_list`. Since `ip_addresses` didn't contain any duplicates, I could accomplish this task using the following code:

```python
for element in remove list_list:
# create conditional statement to evaluate if'element' is in 'ip_addresses'
     if element in ip_addresses:

# use the '.remove()' method to remove
# elements from 'ip_addresses'
     ip_addresses.remove(element)

```

- Inside the for loop, I checked if the loop variable element was in the ip_addresses list to avoid errors. If it was, I used ip_addresses.remove(element) to remove it. This ensured all IP addresses in remove_list were successfully removed from ip_addresses.

## update the file with the revised list of IP addresses

- As a final step in my algorithm, I needed to update the allow list file with the revised list of IP addresses. To do so, I first needed to convert the list back into a string. I used the `.join()` method for this:

```pyhton
# convert 'ip_addresses back to a string so that it can be written into a text file
ip_ address = "\n".join(ip_addresses)

```

- The `.join()` method combines items in an iterable into a single string, using a specified separator. I used it to create a string from the `ip_addresses list`, with `"\n"` as the separator to place each element on a new line. This string was then written to `allow_list.txt` using the `.write()` method within a with statement.

```python
# Build 'statement' to rewrite the original file
with open(import_file, "w") as file:

#rewrite the file, replacing its contents with 'ip_addresses'

file.write(ip_addresses)

```

- I used the `open()` function with the `“w”` argument to open the file for writing, which overwrites its contents. Within the with statement, I used the `.write()` method to write the updated `ip_addresses` list to `“allow_list.txt”`, revoking access for removed IP addresses.

## Summary

- I devised an algorithm aimed at removing IP addresses identified in a `remove_list` variable from the `"allow_list.txt"` file, which contains approved IP addresses. This algorithm encompassed several steps: first, opening the file and converting its contents into a string for reading. Subsequently, I converted this string into a list stored in the variable `ip_addresses`.
Next, I iterated through the IP addresses in remove_list, evaluating each element to determine if it belonged to the ip_addresses list. Whenever a match was found, I utilized the .remove() method to eliminate the element from ip_addresses. Following this, I employed the `.join()` method to convert ip_addresses back into a string format, facilitating the overwriting of the contents of the `"allow_list.txt"` file with the revised list of IP addresses.
This process ensures that any IP addresses listed in `remove_list` are effectively removed from the allow list, maintaining the integrity of the access control mechanism.
